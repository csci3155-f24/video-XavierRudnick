"""
This Flask web application allows users to upload chest X-ray images 
to predict lung diseases using a pre-trained convolutional neural network model. 
The model classifies images into four categories: COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. 
Uploaded images are preprocessed to match the model's input format, 
then predicted with confidence level being displayed to the user after.
